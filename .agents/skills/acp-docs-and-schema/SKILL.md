## ACP architectural limitations:

- **No partial acceptance of file changes:** Users must accept or reject the
  entire file's changes as a unit. The ACP protocol is async and transactional
  (all-or-nothing tool calls). Implementing partial acceptance would require
  complex workarounds (e.g., auto-accepting then partially reverting) which adds
  significant complexity. This feature is deferred/out of scope.

## Message flow and tool call lifecycle

Required reading for working on adapters, `MessageWriter`, `SessionManager`, or
`PermissionManager`.
