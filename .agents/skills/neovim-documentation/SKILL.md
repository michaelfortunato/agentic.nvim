# Neovim Documentation Files and help docs

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT run `nvim --headless` or any other `nvim` command to read
help documentation. Use direct file access instead.

**Why:** Running `nvim` commands can hang, cause race conditions, or interfere
with development environment.

## Neovim Documentation Lookup Strategy:

Always prefer reading local documentation files directly from the Neovim runtime
path, because they reflect the exact version installed on the system.

Common path patterns for discovery:

- **macOS (Homebrew):**
  - Runtime docs: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/neovim/*/share/nvim/runtime/doc/`
  - Note: We don't need the exact version, just use the wildcard `*` to match
    the installed version
- **Linux (Snap):** `/snap/nvim/current/usr/bin/nvim`
  - Runtime docs: `/snap/nvim/current/usr/share/nvim/runtime/doc/`

**If local lookup fails:** Use GitHub raw URLs (least preferred)

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovim/neovim/refs/tags/v<version>/runtime/doc/<doc-name>.txt
```

**Tip:** Do not assume a file contains what you need, use `rg`, or `grep` on the
`runtime/doc` folder to find the file containing needed info.
